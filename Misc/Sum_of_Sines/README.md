# Sum of Sines

 made another pretty cool ASCII-betical flag,
 but my computer frequently turns it into sum'
 sines :( Can you get it back for me? Maybe, by transforming it?

Notes:
* Wrap the string in the flag format. UMDCTF-{*string*}
* If you don't use zero-based indexing (i.e. MATLAB), your characters may be one off.
