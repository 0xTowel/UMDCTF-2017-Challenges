# UMDCTF-2017-Challenges
A selection of challenges from UMDCTF 2017. UMDCTF was a 6-hour, on-site CTF held April 22nd.

# About
These are available now as a resource for others to use to help practice and teach computer security, CTF, and critical thinking.
Each challenge is the respective work of the listed author. The flags are not listed so you can give them to others as a teaching resource
without spoiling the challenge, however the `SHA-256` sum of every flag is included so you can check your work.

Not every challenge is included here, as some required on-site participation (such as the badge challenge).

# Reuse
Feel free to use these challenges to help learn and teach others; just providing attribution. 

# Checking your flags
As mentioned above, the flags are not included. If you wish to check your answer, you may sha256sum and compare it with the given sum.

To properly generate the sha256 for each flag, you may use following:

    echo -n "UMDCTF-{unique_part_of_a_flag}" | sha256sum

which would generate the following hash: `6fe5d2a3ff1465d5eaad91deba29b7879ccc46697dfc250a0736ff4fc1f7c9cf`
